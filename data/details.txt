The CrowCanyon simulations use the 40 step FastPM scheme in
3200 Mpc/h boxes with 6144^3 particles. The box is slightly repliated to
provide half sky coverage (NGP, z > 0) and a redshift coverage from 0 to
2.2.


boxsize = 3200.

output_redshifts= {2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.25, 1.0, 0.55, 0.0}  -- redshifts of output

The job scripts and log files are at:

/global/project/projectdirs/m3127/crowcanyon/desi-6144-9200-40eae2464.job

(and other seeds). It is probably the most authoritive source.
Also be aware that parameters are printed at the head of each log file,
and a string version is also stored in the attrs of the catalog.
(only lua can parse it)

The power spectrum file is referenced in the referenced lua file, and so
are the cosmology parameter and the random seeds (9200 .... 9209).
